Looks like what I "invented" ;) here is only the most basic type of
non-deterministic(?) recursive descent parser with backtracking. 
I.e. the simplest of all. :)

(Note to self (as usual): Actually reading the literature wouldn't have
helped at all in this case. In fact, it would have hindered immensely. 
As this simplistic parser is closer to *pondering* than to any sort real 
or strong grasp of the theory, a) I fortunately didn't require it for 
this, and b) tying to learn it properly first would have been an obstacle 
I'd have never overcome.)
