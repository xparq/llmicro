* Objectify to give it a nice & simple API? But I like the current "stateless"
  version so much... (I'll need to measure it a bit at least.)

* OPs and ATOMs should be merged?

DONE:
=============================================================================

+ Study a bit what the surprisingly deep recursion levels actually depend on,
  and how could that be optimized. (I read somewhere that if not proceeding 
  forward with matching a rule, then no recursion is needed. What to make of 
  that?)

  -> Umm, that was not the recursion level at all, but the total number of
     rule-matching tried... So now I "optimized" that bug away...

- Change it to only pass the start position, rather than new strings all the time!
  I tried, but the positions were strangely off, with an accumulating error,
  and I didn't feel like debugging it. Also: it required 
  `while(!empty($text[$pos]))` checks, and it reminded me again how this whole
  idea of directly indexing a string is not UTF8-safe at all anyway. The 
  other string functions like substr and strlen etc. at least have their 
  mb_... counterparts.

+ !NOTE: The reported recursion levels even change depending *solely* on
  what the define('MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH', 115) is$! :-ooo Failing rules
  seem to max it out, but *won't* throw exception! :-o I'm baffled.
  That counter and the reporting stuff seems to be completely off, and 
  I just can't see where. :-o
  -> Hehh, ehhehe... Umm... Don't tell anyone, but it was *decremented* 
     from from the initial max. rather than incrementing till the limit! :)

+ Try the grammars with the optional trailing marks in the tests!
