* Study a bit what the surprising recursion levels actually depend on!
  !NOTE: The reported recursion levels even change depending *solely* on
  what the define('MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH', 115) is$! :-ooo Failing rules
  seem to max it out, but *won't* throw exception! :-o I'm baffled.
  That counter and the reporting stuff seems to be completely off, and 
  I just can't see where. :-o

* Change it to only pass the start position, rather than new strings all the time!
* OPs and ATOMs should be merged?
